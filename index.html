    <h2> Viva el Perro </h2>

    <p>This is my dog named "Spotlight". I had him since he was a puppy and he has been my number one pal since i got him back in 2017. He's a full bred Shih Tzu but we always cut his hair low so you wouldn't even tell. To me he's just special, always wants to play and just loves Vienna sausages.</p>
    <p> As much as he will destroy stuff and make a mess around the house I still love him and can't be mad at him for too long. I hope he gets to live as long as an adorable dog like him possible can.</p>

   <h2> Manchester United</h2>
   <p><em>October 7, 2024</em></p>

   <p>econdly, this is the club I support, Manchester United. Lately this club has been nothing but disappointing but at the same time this is the club I've been supporting since primary school and has been home to some of my favorite football players such as Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡, Nani, Rashford (when in form) and i cant forget about the Greatest of all time, Cristiano Ronaldo, SIUUUUU!!!!!.</p>
   <p>Throughout all the ups and down this is the club I grew up with and my father supports so I will stick to them and defend them until the end.</technolp>
